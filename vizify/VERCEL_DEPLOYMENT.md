# Vizify Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Vizify application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A Vercel account (create one at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
2. Vercel CLI installed (optional, for command-line deployments)
3. Git installed on your local machine
4. Node.js and npm installed

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy from Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Create a Git Repository**
   - Push your Vizify project to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
   - Ensure all files are committed, including:
     - `vercel.json`
     - Next.js configuration files
     - API routes
     - React components

2. **Import Project to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select the repository where you pushed your Vizify project
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project

3. **Configure Project Settings**
   - Project Name: `vizify` (or your preferred name)
   - Framework Preset: Next.js (should be auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` (if your project is in a subdirectory, specify it here)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (default)
   - Output Directory: `./out` (Next.js default)

4. **Set Environment Variables (if needed)**
   - Click on "Environment Variables" to add any necessary variables
   - For development vs. production settings, use Vercel's environment feature

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application
   - Once complete, you'll receive a URL to access your application

### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Navigate to Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vizify
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   
   Follow the interactive prompts to complete deployment.

5. **For Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected to a Git repository, Vercel automatically deploys:
- Every push to the main branch (as a production deployment)
- Pull requests (as preview deployments)

## Custom Domains

To add a custom domain:

1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click on "Domains"
3. Add your domain and follow the verification steps

## Monitoring & Logs

- Access deployment logs from your Vercel dashboard
- View real-time logs by clicking on a specific deployment
- Monitor performance metrics in the "Analytics" tab

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails:

1. Check build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in package.json
3. Verify that your vercel.json configuration is correct
4. Test your application locally with `npm run build` to catch any build errors

## Local Development vs. Vercel Deployment

Some key differences to be aware of:

1. **Environment Variables**: Local `.env` files don't automatically transfer to Vercel
2. **API Routes**: API routes work the same in both environments
3. **Serverless Functions**: Vercel's serverless functions have a maximum execution time
