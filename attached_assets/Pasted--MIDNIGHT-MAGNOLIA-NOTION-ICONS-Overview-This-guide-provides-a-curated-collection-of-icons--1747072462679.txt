## Custom Icon Creation

For even more brand alignment, consider creating custom Notion icons:

1. Design simplified versions of your brand elements in a square format
2. Create them as PNG files with transparent backgrounds
3. Ensure they're 280px × 280px for optimal display
4. Use your brand's color palette exclusively

Potential custom icons to create:

- Magnolia flower silhouette
- Crescent moon with subtle gold gradient
- Spanish moss hanging from branch
- Gold wax seal with "MM" monogram
- Silhouette of woman in flowing dress
- Antique key with magnolia detail
- Lantern with golden light
- Open book with magnolia bookmark
- Medicine jar with herbs
- Midnight blue water with gold reflection

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Hierarchy:**
   - Apply icons to all existing pages
   - Ensure consistency in parent/child relationships
   - Use higher-status icons (crown, building) for more important pages

2. **Create Color System:**
   - Add color blocks beside icons for visual organization
   - Use consistent colors for specific content types
   - Consider seasonal color shifts for cyclical content

3. **Develop Templates:**
   - Create new page templates with appropriate icons pre-assigned
   - Include icon guidance in template instructions
   - Maintain icon consistency across related content

4. **Mobile Consideration:**
   - Test icon visibility on mobile devices
   - Ensure icons are distinguishable at smaller sizes
   - Prioritize contrast for better visibility

## Brand Alignment Tips

- Favor mystical, nature-based, and elegant icons over technical or modern ones
- Use moon phase icons to indicate project progress or content status
- Include botanical elements (magnolia, herbs, trees) for growth-related content
- Employ celestial symbols (stars, moons) for visionary or transformational content
- Incorporate Southern Gothic elements (houses, gates, mirrors) for heritage themes

By implementing this icon system, your Notion workspace will visually align with your Midnight Magnolia brand while improving organization and navigation for your Patreon content creation.
