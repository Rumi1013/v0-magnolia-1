# The 12 Digital Products That Are Making People RICH

**Time Interval**: 00:00:00 – 00:19:51

## Summary

- 🎨 **Canvas-Shaped Frames**: Customizable and trendy products that have generated over **$822,000** on Etsy; users create custom frames using Canva and Photoshop alternatives.  
- 📚 **Themed Activity Packs**: Holiday-themed digital activity books (e.g., Valentine's Day) are top-sellers, pulling in **over $1,700 per day** for successful listings on Etsy and Amazon.  
- 🏡 **AI-Generated Home Ideas**: AI image packs (e.g., home and garden designs) are successfully sold on eBay, employing scarcity tactics to drive sales.  
- 🖼️ **Vintage Art Downloads**: Public domain artworks are legally downloadable and resalable, leading some sellers to earn over **$1.2 million** by also offering print-on-demand services.  
- 🖌️ **Maximalist Art Bundles**: Bulk art packages are popular among students and renters; single bundles have made up to **$95,000** in passive income.  
- 🔮 **Personalized Reports & Experiences**: Custom digital services like tarot readings or color palettes have generated **$339,000+** in sales.  
- 💌 **Printable Greeting Cards**: Seasonal printable card packs emphasize visual consistency and have achieved high download volumes (e.g., 58 downloads/day).  
- 🐕 **AI-Enhanced Personalized Gifts**: Custom AI-created portraits are booming, with individual Etsy listings making close to **$940,000**.  
- 🛠️ **Business Starter Kits**: Complete kits (like interior design starter packs) have made over **$170,000**, emphasizing the importance of using Canva templates for efficiency.

- 📓 **Niche Aesthetic Planners and Journals**: Specialized planners (e.g., astrology-themed) generate **$200,000+** with lower competition than generic planners.

## Follow-up Exploratory Questions and Answers

1. **What does the video say about how Canva can help in creating digital products?**  
   - Canva plays a central role by providing pre-built templates and design tools that reduce the time and skill needed to create professional-looking digital products. It is used to make canvas frames, activity packs, greeting cards, business kits, and journals. Canva Pro also enables advanced customization and exporting.  
2. **What does the video say about the advantages of selling on eBay compared to Etsy?**  
   - eBay has a different customer base that often prefers instant purchases. Certain digital products like AI-generated home ideas and face-swapped gifts perform better there. Sellers also use scarcity tactics on eBay to create urgency, which helps drive quicker sales compared to Etsy.  
3. **What does the video say about how to legally sell vintage artwork online?**  
   - The video explains that once artwork's copyright expires (typically 70 years after the creator's death), it enters the public domain and can be legally resold. Creators can find these artworks on sources like the Library of Congress, Wikipedia, or Flickr. Enhancing them with tools like Canva and selling them digitally or via print-on-demand is a common and legal strategy.
